                    <p><font size=4>We will be speaking about Offer Networks, Open Collaboration Networks, Attentional Offer Networks, Open Production Networks, post-monetary, sharing, gift economies and everything around them. Our goal is to establish a scientific and technical collaboration among interested parties organized as an Open Value Network.</font></p>

                    <p><font size=4>The emergence of artificial general intelligence and the global brain provides new opportunities for realizing humanityâ€™s long quest for a more utopian existence. It opens a possibility for the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines as the state gradually withers away. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Of er networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain. </font></p>
